Google News Web Scraper

Let's you pick a topic you want to analyse data for and read about.

Prints out a list of the 15 most commonly used words in the titles of the latest news for the topic you selected. The list is filtered to be without any stop words (most common words in a language) nor any punctuation marks.

Outputs the results and links for the keyword you searched for to a docx (Microsoft Word) file.

Usage instructions: This program can be started from the console or terminal using python3 webscraper.py
